<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request was for a raffle platform, RafflyWin. This evolved into a full-featured application with user roles, admin dashboards, PWA capabilities, and multi-language support.

Recent requests implemented in this session:
1.  **Admin Dashboard Enhancements:** Implemented a large set of new tools for the Super Admin, including a user detail modal, enhanced filtering for reviews, and a user registration history table.
2.  **Social Media Redesign:** Reworked the application's landing page into a social media-style feed (similar to Instagram/TikTok) with infinite scroll. This included backend support for posts, likes, featured creators, and a new public feed API. The creator profile page was also updated to match this new design.
3.  **Full Site Translation:** Completed the internationalization (i18n) for previously untranslated pages.
4.  **Bug Fixes & Cleanup:**
    *   Resolved a critical deployment issue on the user's VPS caused by conflicting PM2 processes.
    *   Created a script to seed the database with mock data for testing.
    *   Removed the Made with Emergent badge and associated scripts from the entire application.
5.  **New Request:** The user has requested to improve the visual separation between items in the new social media feed, as it's currently hard to distinguish where one post ends and another begins.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish. The user communicates exclusively in Spanish. The next agent **MUST** respond in Spanish.

**what currently exists?**
The RafflyWin application is a full-stack MVP (React, FastAPI, MongoDB).
-   **Core:** User authentication (User, Creator, Super Admin), profile management, raffle creation.
-   **UI/UX:** The landing page is now a social media-style feed with infinite scroll, displaying a mix of raffles and posts from creators. There are featured creators highlighted at the top. The application is a PWA and supports Spanish, English, and Portuguese.
-   **Admin Panel:** A unified, role-based dashboard at  provides powerful tools for the Super Admin, including user/creator management, raffle oversight, and statistics.
-   **Deployment:** The application is deployed on the user's VPS. The deployment process is manual and has been a source of recurring issues, which were debugged in this session.
-   **Data:** A mock data seeding script has been created and run, populating the application with users, creators, and raffles for a richer testing experience.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested an improvement to the UI of the social feed on the landing page to better visually distinguish between posts.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool. This is a purely visual change, so a screenshot of the updated feed will be sufficient to verify the fix.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Improve Visual Separation in Feed (P0)**
    -   **Description:** The user finds it difficult to distinguish where one feed card ends and another begins on the new social media-style landing page.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** Modify the CSS for the  component () or its container in  to add clear visual separators like borders, box-shadows, or increased margins.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To improve the user experience and readability of the main feed.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.
-   **Issue 2: Deployment Instability on VPS (P1)**
    -   **Description:** The user frequently encounters issues when deploying new code to their VPS, including permission errors and process conflicts. The last session involved debugging an address already in use error caused by two separate PM2 instances (one for , one for  user) competing for the same port.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent successfully guided the user to kill the conflicting processes and unify management under one PM2 instance. Manual deployment steps were provided.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** While the immediate issue is resolved, the manual process is error-prone. The best long-term solution is to create an automated  script to handle pulling from git, installing dependencies, building the frontend, and restarting services correctly.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To provide a stable, one-command deployment process, eliminating a major source of user frustration and recurring support requests.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both (the deployment process itself).
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Paddle Payment Integration (P1)**
    -   **Where to resume:** The integration is blocked. The agent needs to receive the Paddle API credentials from the user.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** Enable real payment processing for raffle tickets.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    -   **Blocked on something:** Awaiting API keys from the user.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **Implement Admin Earnings Tab (P2):** Blocked on Paddle integration.
    -   **Full Notification System (P3):** Implement a user-facing notification bell for key events (e.g., new followers, raffle wins).
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **Personalized Explore Feed:** Develop a recommendation algorithm for the explore page.
    -   **Creator Posts:** Allow creators to upload photos and status updates to their profiles, which will appear in the main feed. (Backend models exist, but frontend for creation is needed).

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Social Media Feed Redesign:** Completely redesigned the  into a dynamic, infinitely-scrolling feed similar to Instagram/TikTok, featuring posts and raffles.
-   **Featured Creator System:** Implemented functionality for admins to mark creators as featured, who then appear in a stories section at the top of the feed.
-   **Comprehensive Admin Enhancements:** Added a user detail modal, advanced filtering for the reviews tab, and a user registration history table to the Super Admin dashboard.
-   **Full Site Translation:** Completed the internationalization (i18n) for remaining pages (, , , ).
-   **Deployment Debugging:** Solved a critical address already in use error on the user's VPS by identifying and stopping a conflicting PM2 process running under a different user.
-   **Mock Data Script:** Created and executed a  script to populate the database for better testing and a more realistic UI.
-   **Branding Cleanup:** Removed the Made with Emergent badge and associated scripts from .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Deployment Instability on VPS:** This issue persists. The root cause of the latest incident (conflicting PM2 instances) was fixed, but the underlying vulnerability of a complex manual deployment process remains.

**All files of reference**
-   : Completely rewritten to be the new social media feed.
-   : The core UI for displaying content in the new feed.
-   : Contains all new backend logic for the feed, posts, likes, and enhanced admin features.
-   : The new script for generating test data.
-   : Contains the new UI for toggling featured creators.
-   : Redesigned to show pinned raffles and a feed of posts.
-   : The file where the Emergent badge was removed.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Deployment Process:** The manual VPS deployment is the biggest recurring pain point. An automated  script is a high-priority improvement to ensure stability.
-   ** Component:** This component continues to grow and should be broken down into smaller, more manageable components for each tab/feature to improve maintainability.

    -    (public creator profile)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **¡Habla español!** All communication with the user must be in Spanish.
-   **Production Deployment:** The user's main pain point is deploying code to their production VPS. They have experienced  and port conflicts. You must be prepared to assist with deployment-related questions. The most important fix was discovering and stopping a second  instance running as the  user, which was conflicting with the  user's .
-   **Social Feed is the New Core:** The application's primary user experience is now the social media feed on the landing page. All unauthenticated users land here.
-   **Immediate Task:** The next task is a simple but important UI fix: adding visual separation between cards in the main feed to improve readability.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User:** Reports a console error and that the landing page is not loading anything. Also requests a mock data script and the removal of the Made with Emergent badge. (COMPLETED)
2.  **Agent:** Identifies the error is because the user is viewing their production site, which doesn't have the new code deployed yet. Confirms the feature works locally.
3.  **Agent:** Removes the Made with Emergent badge and creates the mock data script. (COMPLETED)
4.  **User:** Reports the same error persists on their production site. (IN PROGRESS)
5.  **Agent:** Explains the issue is a deployment problem on the user's VPS and provides manual deployment steps.
6.  **User:** Reports they cannot restart the  process with  on their VPS. (IN PROGRESS)
7.  **Agent & User (multiple messages):** A back-and-forth debugging session where they discover an address already in use error, kill lingering processes, and find out two separate  instances (one for , one for ) are conflicting. (COMPLETED)
8.  **Agent:** Provides the final commands to stop the conflicting  instance, leaving only the correct one running.
9.  **User:** Confirms the site is now loading correctly. (COMPLETED)
10. **User:** the design should be improved a bit so that the posts are better distinguished, right now it is difficult to distinguish where one ends and where another begins (PENDING - This is the current )

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:**
    -   Paddle payment integration remains non-functional and blocked pending user credentials.
-   **Mocked:**
    -   The Earnings tab in the admin panel is a UI placeholder.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Paddle (Payments):** Blocked, awaiting user API keys.
-   **i18next:** Integrated and functional for multi-language support.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES. Both backend and frontend testing agents were used successfully after the implementation of the social feed feature.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
| Role | Email | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Super Admin |  |  |
| Creator |  |  |
| User |  |  |

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent successfully handled all user requests in this session. The only incomplete long-term plan is the creation of an automated  script, which was proposed in the previous handoff and is still a highly relevant solution to the user's recurring deployment problems, even though the immediate issue was resolved manually.</analysis>
